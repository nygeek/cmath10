# Complex Decimal Math

This repository represents the development environment for the
cmath10.py module.  This module is an adjunct to the decimal.py
module.

The decimal.py module provides basic arithmetic machinery for
arbitrary-length numbers with underlying representation in
decimal.  This representation, wasteful in many contexts, is
useful in accounting situations and in some other circumstances.

For reference, check the decimal.py documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html
